# Simulation
A personal project to investgate different modes of transit, and the effects they have

I plan to use Python and <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/">ArcGIS API<a> to map and visualize data used in Civil Planning. 
  
### Goals
- [ ] Include a Weighted Decision Matrix exploring different modes of transit for specified corridors
