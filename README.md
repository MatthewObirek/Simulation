# Simulation
A personal project to investgate different modes of transit, and the effects they have

I plan to use Python and <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/">ArcGIS API<a> to map and visualize data used in Civil Planning. 
  
### Goals
- [ ] Include a Weighted Decision Matrix exploring different modes of transit for specified corridors
- [ ] For over mountain trips, I would like to put in average speed, max speed, and Max time traveled to optimise the creation of the hypothetical route.
    - [ ] Max speed would be based of off max grade and max turn radius.
    - [ ] lower average speed, paired with max speed, would allow for "shorter routes" with more bends or switch banks.
    - [ ] Max Time travelled will be the biggest determiner of the route, paired only with grade.
