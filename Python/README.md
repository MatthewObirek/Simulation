# Simulation
A personal project to investgate different modes of transit, and the effects they have

I plan to use Python, <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/TkinterMapView">Tkintermapview</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/">Google MAPS API</a> to map and visualize data used in Civil Planning. I also Plan on using osm file that contain Rail way information. I want to use all the data I can to map out Smooth paths for potential transit - highway, rail, or otherwise - For Civil Planning.

### API_KEY and Running Project
Because I do not want to share my API key with anyone. I have saved it to a file that is not in the git repo. To run this software, you must create a `API_KEY.txt` File, and put *your own* API key on the first line.
# Goals
- [ ] Create a layer on top of the map - that maps to the *tile* that shows a gradiant of elivation.
